# **Retail Analytics and Strategy Insights**
### *A Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Amazon, Walmart, and Costco*

---

### **Project Overview**
This project provides an in-depth analysis of retail giants **Amazon**, **Walmart**, and **Costco**, focusing on:
- Leveraging search trends, website content, and customer sentiment to shape brand strategies.
- Correlating retail strategies with stock performance during peak retail events.
- Developing a **stock recommendation system** based on financial metrics like PE ratio, stock trends, and customer sentiment.

Using **Wolfram Mathematica**, the project demonstrates actionable insights for retail and investment strategy optimization.

### **Objective**
To analyze how retail giants leverage key metrics and trends to:
- Shape brand strategies.
- Drive customer engagement during peak retail events.
- Provide informed stock recommendations to investors (**Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**).

### **Key Insights**
1. **Search Trends & Content Strategy**:
   - Amazon aligns website content with customer search trends during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
   - Walmart localizes content to boost in-store engagement.

2. **Stock Performance Correlation**:
   - Costco exhibits consistent stock performance linked to customer sentiment trends.
   - Walmart stock shows sensitivity to quarterly revenue announcements.

3. **Retail Stock Recommendation System**:
   - Evaluates **PE ratios**, **market capitalization**, and **customer sentiment** trends.
   - Uses logic-driven recommendations for retail stocks:
     - **Buy**: Low PE ratio (< 15) and high market cap (> $50 billion).
     - **Hold**: Moderate PE ratio (15–25).
     - **Sell**: High PE ratio (> 25) or low market cap.

### **Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Language**: Wolfram Mathematica
- **Data Visualization**: Wolfram Language functions like `BarChart`, `PieChart`, and `DateListPlot`.
- **Data Sources**: Retail search trends, customer sentiment, financial metrics from publicly available datasets.
- **App Logic**: Dynamic data retrieval, caching, and custom logic for financial analysis.
